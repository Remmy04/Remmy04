## 💬 Words That Keep Me Going

Here’s a little collection of quotes that inspire and motivate me on my coding journey:

> “Don’t compare yourself to others. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday.”  
> “Every expert was once a beginner.”  
> “Fall seven times, stand up eight.”  
> “It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.”  
> “The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.”  
> “Every line of code is a step forward. Let's keep learning!”
